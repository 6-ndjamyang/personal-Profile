## Documentation
Main Concepts and Skills Applied
For my web project with personal profile, about me, and contacts pages, I used semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS for styling it. I focused on organizing content well, so users can easily find what they need with clear navigation. Adding fixed sidebars for quick access to social media links was a neat feature that helped with usability.

## New Skills Acquired
This project really improved my Tailwind CSS skills. I learned how to create layouts and make sure everything was accessible with the right contrast and elements. I also learned to add SVG icons, which made the pages look nicer.

## Reflection
What I Learned: I realized how important user-centered design is. It influenced how I organized information and kept it easy to access. Tailwind’s utility-first approach helped me focus on layout and content without getting lost in custom styles, keeping everything consistent.

## Challenges Faced
I faced some problems with maintaining a consistent design. At first, some elements didn’t align well, but I fixed it using Tailwind CSS and with a helping hand from AI. I also worked hard to make sure spacing and font sizes matched by using Tailwind’s utility classes.

Overall, this project was very helpful in improving my web development skills and gave me lots of insights into building functional, good-looking web pages.
